## Pipe Up

This program aims to mimic the pipe command, by using fork, creating sub processes and then passing input within thesse process. 

## Building
To build the program, we must first run the build process.
Secondly, make sure the process is cleaned ny running make clean.
Then run make.


## Running

./pipe ls sort
 the output is: 
 Makefile
README.md
__pycache__
pipe
pipe.c
pipe.dSYM
pipe.o
test_lab1.py

## Cleaning up

make clean
rm -rf __pycache__
rm -rf pipe.dSYM
